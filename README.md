# Introduction

This project was created for Code Institute's first-ever #women-in-tech Hackathon.

We decide to join to this fest  to inspire, connect and grow with Code Institute's Women in Tech community!

Each of us have other coding experience, we are on different levels, but we would like to work together and create an incredible amazing page and still have fun and feel like the "small coding family" in our team. 

We decide to create a webpage which will helps other womans gathering some informations from female mentors about that what IT means today, what it can have to offer and which path each women should choose.

## Wireframes

# Features

To keep consistently layout we decide to keep the same navbar and footer on all our subpages, which are Home, Mentors and Events.

## Home page

This page was inspired on Netflix page. We wanted achive a similar effect, which we achived. We have only limited data here with  mentor and events pages in navbar and our social media links in footer. At  the center of home page (on hero image is call to action button which allows our users to register to our newsletter).   

## Mentors page

Here are presented womXn mentors which are passionate about technology. Our visitors can read more about backgrounds and cultures, their work and path which they have chosen. They also can register to get access to be able to connect with our mentors and be part of the program provided by womXn. 

## Events page 

This is "cream de la cream" in our project. Here our visitors:
-  can join us for our weekly tech talk (in section TECH TALKS),
-  imrprove they own skills in our WomXn's Online Web Development Bootcamp, available in CODING BOOTCAMP section, 
- or will work during WOMXN HACKATHON which is an intensive event where our users will be presented with a problem and have 5 days to come up with a really good idea how to solve that problem.
